ðŸ‘‹ Hey there!

I am an experienced python/django & node/typescript fullstack engineer. In a quest to become a better programmer I have started on a journey to add other languages and skills to my toolbox. You can follow my journey on [My Site](https://richkevan.com)

I have previously worked with C#/ASP.NET, but not touched in in several years. This is my first commit of my journey to reaquint myself with this language and add it to my skillset.

In addition to C# I am also going to be refreshing/broadening my knowledge of
1. Node/Typescrip
2. Python/Django
3. Php/Laravel 

Along this journey I will also be devoting time to picking up
1. Go
2. Flutter
3. Ruby

I am also in conjuction with the projects I build going to use every opportunity to brushup on the complimentary technologies.
1. SQL(PostgreSQL, MySQL)
2. NoSQL(MongoDB)
3. Redis
4. Docker

I hope you will follow me adventures and cheer me on along the way
